# Bank Loan System

MVP, created at INAI hackathon (april 11-12), that provides a template for AI Integrated Scoring and Admin Panel.


## Deployment

To deploy this project run this in  the source folder:

```bash
  abp install-libs
```

and install ollama's model llama3.2.
https://ollama.com/search




To config:

```
and there should be a config, where one would enter his port, API endpoints 
localhost, what model to use etc., but it was not implemented due to the time
 limit (maybe i will create one though)
```


## What was used
1. ABP platform for admin panel (turned out it provided way more functionality than i thought)

2. Ollama for its light model llama3.2

3. .Net 9

4. Postgres



## P.S.

This project is UNUSABLE and is to present the idea we made at the hackathon
